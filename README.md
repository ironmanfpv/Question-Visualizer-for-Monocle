# Question Visualizer for Q&A for Monocle. 

Imagine one of two scenarios:

Scenario one: You are giving a briefing or a presentation. 
Your audience have questions pertaining to what you shared but they are not able to raise it at that point in time. 
You share with them a Google Sheet for them to key in their questions. You have their questions in view.
You handle their questions at an interim juncture.

Scenario two : You are a teacher/lecturer teaching a lesson. Your students have questions. 
They hesitate to raise them as the group size is huge and they are processing their thoughts,trying to phrase their questions. 
You share with them a Google Sheet for them to key in their questions. You have their questions in view. 
You handle their doubts at a Q&A segment.

This app allows you to collate the questions from the shared Google
Sheets using Google Sheets API. The questions are listed and numbered as
they are sequenced in the Google Sheet. The webapp uploads the questions
to Monocle. Toggle forward and backward using the Touch buttons on
Monocle to traverse the uploaded questions.
